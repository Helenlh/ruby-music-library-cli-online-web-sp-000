require_relative '../config/environment'

MusicLibraryController.new.call



in the bin folder you will have a file called musiclibrary


and in the bin/musiclibrary, i will have a method called controller?

It is where you will call the call method on a new instance of your MusicLibraryController class

The controller holds the methods that your cli will use
